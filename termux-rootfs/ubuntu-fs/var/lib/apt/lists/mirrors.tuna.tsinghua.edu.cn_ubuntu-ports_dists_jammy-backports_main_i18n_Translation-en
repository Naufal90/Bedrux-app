Package: libdebuginfod-common
Description-md5: 2119791df8405022ae0834bc3112a0b5
Description-en: configuration to enable the Debian debug info server
 This package asks if it should enable use of the Debian debug info
 server with debugging tools that use libdebuginfo such as GDB.
 .
 When this is allowed by the sysadmin, a snippet will be added to the
 shell configuration. You will need to restart your shell after
 installing this package before the snippet will work.
 .
 The Debian debug info server will be contacted every time debugging
 tools attempt to look up debug info for binaries or libraries but the
 server does not log requests for debug info.
 .
 The Debian debug info server uses https to securely transfer debugging
 files but does not offer OpenPGP signing of debug info.
