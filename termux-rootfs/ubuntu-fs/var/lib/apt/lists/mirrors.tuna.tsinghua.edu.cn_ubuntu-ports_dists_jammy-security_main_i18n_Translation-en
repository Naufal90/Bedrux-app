Description-en: initialization and customization tool for cloud instances
 Cloud-init is the industry standard multi-distribution method for
 cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all major
 public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure,
 and bare-metal installations.
 .
 Cloud instances are initialized from a disk image and instance data:
 .
  * Cloud metadata
  * User data (optional)
  * Vendor data (optional)
 .
 Cloud-init will identify the cloud it is running on during boot, read any
 provided metadata from the cloud and initialize the system accordingly. This
 may involve setting up the network and storage devices to configuring SSH
 access key and many other aspects of a system. Later on the cloud-init will
 also parse and process any optional user or vendor data that was passed to
 the instance.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.

 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.

 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Description-md5: 8b1a42116cc013ab156cd5d15ec1d6d6
Description-en: Linux kernel source for version 5.15.0 with Ubuntu patches
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version
 5.15.0.
 .
 This package is mainly meant for other packages to use, in order to build
 custom flavours.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it
 is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package, which has
 been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image packages.
 .
 If you are simply trying to build third-party modules for your kernel,
 you do not want this package. Install the appropriate linux-ibm-headers
 package instead.

 This package is mainly meant for other packages to use, in order to build
 custom flavours.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it
 is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package, which has
 been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image packages.
 .
 If you are simply trying to build third-party modules for your kernel,
 you do not want this package. Install the appropriate linux-headers
 package instead.

Package: llvm-13
Description-md5: 07d463911771b9679a5f0131f40992d4
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

 directories in the filesystem, and also block devices.  Sessions,
 persistent chroots created on the fly from files (tar with optional
 compression) and Btrfs, ZFS, and LVM snapshots are also supported.

 inside the chroot to have a different personality.  For example,
 running 32-bit chroots on 64-bit systems, or even running binaries
 from alternative operating systems such as SVR4 or Xenix.
