Package: dbus
Description-md5: 8317e43242716ec7f7692a3ac5895e1c
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Package: dbus-user-session
Description-md5: be4453093922af92deac14b4e8458a83
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .
 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

Package: gir1.2-fprint-2.0
Description-md5: dcb442c6f30672e4b3a86ff7e3907584
Description-en: async fingerprint library of fprint project, gir bindings
 The fprint project aims to support for consumer fingerprint reader devices.
 .
 Previously, Linux support for such devices has been scattered amongst different
 projects (many incomplete) and inconsistent in that application developers
 would have to implement support for each type of fingerprint reader separately.
 The idea is to change that by providing a central system to support all the
 fingerprint readers as it's possible to get hands on.
 .
 libfprint is the centre of efforts, this component does the dirty job of
 talking to fingerprint reading devices, and processing fingerprint data.
 .
 This library depends on the new libusb, which performs asynchronous callbacks,
 allowing fprint to perform non-blocking device tasks.

Package: libdbus-1-3
Description-md5: 394b84dd0007d22bc4bb591ca6b5fa31
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.

 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Package: llvm-13
Description-md5: 07d463911771b9679a5f0131f40992d4
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

 increased convenience. Enumerations and bit flags become strings and lists
 of strings in Python. Errors are reported as exceptions rather than integer
 errno-style error codes.  The wrapper takes care to provide one-to-many
 mapping of the error codes to the exceptions by interpreting a context
 in which the error code is produced.

Package: winpr-utils
Description-md5: 5ad5407ece20a3e087a48f65ab4e7aec
Description-en: Windows Portable Runtime library command line utilities
 WinPR is a spin-off project of FreeRDP which aims at providing a portable
 implementation of important portions of the Windows API. Just like FreeRDP,
 WinPR is released under the Apache license. Unlike Wine, WinPR does not provide
 binary compatibility, and does not require applications to be built for
 Windows. Instead, WinPR provides API compatibility for applications targeting
 non-Windows environments. When on Windows, the original native API is being
 used instead of the equivalent WinPR implementation, without having to modify
 the code using it.
 .
 This package contains WinPR command line utils (winpr-hash, winpr-makecert).

Package: xdg-desktop-portal
Description-md5: 7eac259f6a9a24c9e234ad737a8c6945
Description-en: desktop integration portal for Flatpak and Snap
 xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,
 and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service
 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.
 .
 The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.
 .
 xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a
 desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
 to provide its functionality.
