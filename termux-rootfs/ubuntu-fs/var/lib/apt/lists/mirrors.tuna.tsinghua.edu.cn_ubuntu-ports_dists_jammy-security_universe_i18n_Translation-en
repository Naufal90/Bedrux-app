Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Description-md5: 2140d89702ec1cd621b41c71a95a910a
Description-en: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (web interface)
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package configures a web interface for browsing git repositories.
 .
 If apache2 is installed, the web interface is automatically made
 available at http://localhost/gitweb.  Other servers that support CGI
 or mod_perl are supported through manual configuration.
 .
 If libcgi-fast-perl is installed, gitweb can also be run over FastCGI
 (and served by nginx, for example).

Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.

 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package provides the OCaml bindings to develop applications using llvm.

Package: libswresample-dev
Description-md5: 756e0f4df4398b9100298535b7db8417
Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the development files.

Description-en: fast processor emulator, dummy package
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator. Once upon a time there was only one
 package named `qemu', with all functionality included. These days, qemu
 become large and has been split into numerous packages. Different packages
 provides entirely different services, and it is very unlikely one will
 need all of them together. So current `qemu' package makes no sense anymore,
 and is becoming a dummy package.
 .
 If you want full system emulation of some architecture, install one or more
 of qemu-system-ARCH packages. If you want user-mode emulation, install
 qemu-user or qemu-user-static package. If you need utilities, use qemu-utils
 package.

 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides a daemon (agent) to run inside qemu-system
 guests (full system emulation).  It communicates with the host using
 a virtio-serial channel org.qemu.guest_agent.0, and allows one to perform
 some functions in the guest from the host, including:
  - querying and setting guest system time
  - performing guest filesystem sync operation
  - initiating guest shutdown or suspend to ram
  - accessing guest files
  - freezing/thawing guest filesystem operations
  - others.

Package: ripgrep
Description-md5: 45d1dfa98f350bc31d65169b0acf761d
Description-en: Recursively searches directories for a regex pattern
 ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current
 directory for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore rules and
 automatically skip hidden files/directories (smart filtering) and binary files.
 ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack
 and grep.
 .
 ripgrep is generally faster than both The Silver Searcher and GNU grep. It
 defaults to recursive directory search and won't search files ignored by your
 `.gitignore` files. Use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
 bugs, and Unicode support.
 .
 On the other hand, if you like multiline search, then ripgrep may not quite
 meet your needs (yet), and it will never support fancy regex features such as
 backreferences or lookaround

Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
